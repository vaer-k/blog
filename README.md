## Prerequisites

You will need [Leiningen][1] 2.0 or above installed.

[1]: https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen

## Running

You will need create environment variables for the database configuration. One way to accomplish this is to create files called `dev-config.edn` and `test-config.edn`, then put a single map in them with `:port` and `:database-url` keys.

To start a web server for the application, run:

    lein run
